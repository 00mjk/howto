howto is a terminal client for getting stackoverflow Answers for those who are constantly googling for doing basic programming tasks.
Now it uses both google as well as Stackoverflow to get the results, because lets agree, google's search algorithm is way better than stackoverflow's search algorithm.

It is inspired by [Howdoi](https://github.com/gleitz/howdoi) and is purely written in Go
